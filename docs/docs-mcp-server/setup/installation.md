# Installation

This guide covers the various ways to install and run the Docs MCP Server.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using the standalone server, which includes both the MCP endpoints and the web interface in a single process.

### Option 1: Node.js (npx)

If you have Node.js 22.x installed (recommended for local development), you can run the server directly with a single command. Use `nvm use 22` and run `npm rebuild` if you recently changed Node versions:

```bash
npx @arabold/docs-mcp-server@latest
```

This runs the server on port 6280 by default. Open **[http://localhost:6280](http://localhost:6280)** to access the web interface.

**Optional:** Prefix with `OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"` to enable vector search for improved results.

### Option 2: Docker

Running via Docker ensures you have all dependencies without polluting your host system.

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v docs-mcp-data:/data \
  -v docs-mcp-config:/config \
  -p 6280:6280 \
  ghcr.io/arabold/docs-mcp-server:latest \
  --protocol http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6280
```

**Configuration:** The server writes its configuration to `/config/docs-mcp-server/config.yaml`. Mounting the `/config` volume ensures your settings persist across restarts.

**Optional:** Add `-e OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"` to enable vector search for improved results.

### Configure Your Client

Once the server is running (on port 6280), you need to tell your AI client where to find it.

**Example: Cursor**

Add this to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docs-mcp-server": {
      "type": "streamableHttp",
      "url": "http://localhost:6280/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

See **[Connecting MCP Clients](../guides/mcp-clients.md)** for instructions for **Claude**, **Cline**, **Zed**, and others.

**Optional:** To improve search quality, see **[Embedding Models](../guides/embedding-models.md)** to configure OpenAI, Ollama, or other providers.

## 🔌 Embedded Server

You can run the MCP server directly embedded in your AI assistant without a separate process or web interface. This provides MCP integration only.

Add this to your MCP settings (VS Code, Claude Desktop, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docs-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@arabold/docs-mcp-server@latest"],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

**With Vector Search (API Key):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docs-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@arabold/docs-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-proj-..."
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** When running in embedded mode, you lose access to the Web Interface unless you launch it separately (see [Basic Usage](../guides/basic-usage.md)).

## 🐳 Advanced: Docker Compose (Scaling)

For production deployments or when you need to scale processing, use Docker Compose to run separate services. The system selects either a local in-process worker or a remote worker client based on the configuration.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arabold/docs-mcp-server.git
    cd docs-mcp-server
    ```

2.  **Set your environment variables:**

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
    ```

3.  **Start all services:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

### Service Architecture

-   **Worker** (port 8080): Handles documentation processing jobs.
-   **MCP Server** (port 6280): Provides `/sse` endpoint for AI tools.
-   **Web Interface** (port 6281): Browser-based management interface.

See [Deployment Modes](../infrastructure/deployment-modes.md) for more architectural details.
